# Cookie Cats A/B Test Analysis

Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game by Tactile Entertainment. Players connect tiles of the same color to clear levels. The game features gates that delay progress unless an in-app purchase is made. This project analyzes an A/B test where the first gate was moved from level 30 to 40, focusing on its impact on player retention.
