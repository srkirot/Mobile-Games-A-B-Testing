# Cookie Cats A/B Test Analysis

Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game by Tactile Entertainment. Players connect tiles of the same color to clear levels. This project analyzes an A/B test where the first gate was moved from level 30 to level 40, focusing on its impact on player retention.

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of an A/B test conducted on Cookie Cats to evaluate the effect of moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 on player retention. The analysis includes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data visualization, outlier management, and statistical hypothesis testing.

## Analyzing Player Retention

Understand how the change in gate placement influenced player retention after one and seven days.

- **Retention for gate 30:**
  - Day 1: 44.82%
  - Day 7: 19.02%

- **Retention for gate 40:**
  - Day 1: 44.23%
  - Day 7: 18.20%

## Hypothesis Testing

- H0: 𝜇1=𝜇2 (There is no significant difference in retention between gate 30 and gate 40)
- H1: 𝜇1≠𝜇2 (There is a significant difference in retention between gate 30 and gate 40)

Statistical tests were performed to determine significant differences between gate 30 and gate 40.

- **Student's t-test for retention 7:**
  - p-value = 0.0016 (significant difference found)

- **Levene's test for equality of variances:**
  - p-value = 0.0744 (similar variances for retention 1)
  - p-value = 0.0016 (different variances for retention 7)

 
## Significance Level (0.05)

The significance level, also known as alpha (α), is used to determine the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis (H0). A value of 0.05 is commonly chosen because:

- Convention: It is a widely accepted standard.
- Error Control: An alpha of 0.05 implies a 5% probability of committing a Type I error (rejecting H0 when it is true).
- Comparability: It allows results to be comparable with other studies.
  
## Purpose of Levene's Test
Levene's test evaluates the equality of variances between groups, which is crucial for many statistical tests, such as the Student's t-test, that assume equal variances.

- Assumption of Homoscedasticity: Ensures that variances between groups are equal.
- Validity of the Test: Determines whether to use the standard t-test or an adjusted version (such as Welch's t-test).
- Interpretation of Results:
  - p-value > 0.05: Do not reject the null hypothesis; variances are similar.
  - p-value < 0.05: Reject the null hypothesis; variances are significantly different.

## Conclusion

Your results indicate that:

- There is a significant difference in 7-day retention between gate 30 and gate 40.
- The variances of retention 1 are similar between both groups.
